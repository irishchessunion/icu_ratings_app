    %dt Why is an Irish tournament in which I recently played not yet rated?
    %dd
      It's possible that the tournament...
      %ul
        %li has not finished yet (e.g. the Leinster and Munster leagues don't finish until April or May)
        %li report has not yet been received
        %li report has issues so the tournament cannot be rated yet
        %li
          is ready but not yet rated (in this case it will be listed
          = succeed(")") do
            = link_to "here", tournaments_path
        %li is not rateable, e.g. if it has too few rated players
        %li is not eligible, e.g. if it is a rapid or blitz
    %dt What is my latest rating if I haven't played any rated games since 2011?
    %dd= "The one inherited from the old rating system in #{t 'system.new.start'}."
    %dt How can I see the entire history of my published ratings?
    %dd
      Click a published rating on this page (if you have one) to see a graph or
      you can search for your published ratings (and those of other players') here:
      = succeed(",") do
        = link_to "ICU", icu_ratings_path
      = succeed(".") do
        = link_to "FIDE", fide_ratings_path
    %dt Some or all of my FIDE ratings are missing. Can this be fixed?
    %dd
      Please email the
      = succeed(".") do
        = mail_to_icu
    %dt Over what time span are my highest and lowest ICU and FIDE ratings calculated?
    %dd= "From #{t 'system.old.start'} for ICU and from #{t 'system.fide.start'} for FIDE."
    %dt Over what time span are my biggest ICU gains and losses calculated?
    %dd
      From the start of the new rating system,
      = succeed(".") do
        = t "system.new.start"
      Note that the display of gains and losses in individual games is only available for
      players with full ratings.
    %dt Why is my published rating 700 even though my actual rating is less than 700?
    %dd
      For the published rating lists, ratings below 400 are rounded up
      to avoid discouraging beginners.
